How do I approach designing software?
Despite how difficult this class was, I learned a ton that I will apply to my upcoming coding classes. My code was really confusing at first, and it wouldn't make sense to someone else who were to read it. I also found it difficult to add to my code because I kept getting confused during the course. After about five or six weeks, something finally clicked, and I was able to clean up my code. By this I mean that I stopped repeating lines that were unnecessary, commented out what each line did, and thoroughly arranged it such that it was easy to discover the places where further code should be added and that it was just easier to read. This is applicable.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I already work in the IT field, so having as many computer science abilities as possible will help me achieve my goals. As a systems manager, I work a sometimes demanding job. Everyday life is not the same. I've learned from this lesson alone that my efforts will be matched by the results they produce. Although I am aware that saying already exists, until this lesson I never really understood it. This lesson taught me how to test more frequently and to be more organized for my future scholastic path. Although I've always been organized, I plan to become even more so after taking this class because it's easy to become bogged down in one's life.
